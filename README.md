# The scripts of the article: Haplotype-resolved genomes provide insights into the origin and function of genome diversity in bivalves
These scripts were used to generate the analyses for XXXX et al. (XXX).
Details of the methods are in the paper.

Note: these scripts are internal to this project, not currently designed for generic use, so results are not guaranteed for adapt in other work


## Experimental Design
1 individual genome assemble with PacBio HiFi data and Hi-C data

2 population anlysis with DNAseq data from C. sikamea, C. ariakensis, C. angulata, and C. gigas.

3 allele expression anlysis with four RNA-seq datasets, which including:
 a) adductor muscles, mantle, digestive gland, gill and labial palps, were collected from three wild individuals
 b) adductor muscle, digestive gland and labial palps, were collected from four individuals in March
 c) adductor muscle, digestive gland and labial palps, were collected from three individuals in June 
 d) adductor muscle, digestive gland and labial palps, were collected from five individuals in October
