# XXXX genome project scripts
These scripts were used to generate the analyses for XXXX et al. (XXX).
Details of the methods are in the paper.
Contact: XXXXX <XXXX.com>
Note: these scripts are internal to this project, not currently designed for generic use, so results are not guaranteed for adapt in other work.




## Experimental Design
1 individual genome assemble with XXX data

2 population anlysis with XXX data

3 allele expression anlysis with XXX data
